# Pytorch-End-to-End
PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework that provides a flexible and efficient platform for developing and training various machine learning models. It was developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) team and has gained significant popularity in the research and industry communities.

This repository contains an end-to-end PyTorch project that demonstrates various fundamental concepts in deep learning using PyTorch. The project covers the following topics:

### Concepts Covered

* Introduction to Tensors: Learn about tensors, the fundamental data structure in PyTorch, and how to work with them efficiently.
* Moving to GPU: Understand how to leverage the power of GPUs for accelerated training and inference by moving tensors and computations to GPU devices.
* Transformation: Explore data transformations and preprocessing techniques to prepare data for model training.
* Building Models: Learn how to build custom neural network architectures using PyTorch and define forward and backward propagation.
* Common Layers in Neural Network Architecture: Discover commonly used layers in deep learning architectures, such as convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and activation functions.
* Datasets and DataLoaders: Utilize PyTorch's built-in dataset and dataloader utilities to efficiently load and preprocess data for training and evaluation.
* Loss Function: Understand different loss functions and how to choose the appropriate one for your specific task.
* Optimization: Learn about optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and how to train your models effectively.
* Splitting Datasets: Explore techniques for splitting datasets into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate and validate model performance.
* Save and Load Model: Learn how to save trained models to disk and load them for future use or deployment.
